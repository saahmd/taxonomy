     Recommend the "Experience More" plan as it offers unlimited premium data, 
     ideal for high streaming use, and includes Netflix for single-line plans.

      | **Customer ID** | **Avg. Daily Data Usage** | **Streaming Hours/Day** | **Roaming** | **Lines in Plan** |

      | 001              | 6.5 GB                     | 4.5 hrs                   | No           | 1                  |
    question:  Which T-Mobile plan should this customer be recommended?
  - answer: |
       No, the Essentials plan offers limited international features. 
       Recommend upgrading to Experience Beyond for international texting and data in 210+ countries.
    context: |

    question: Is the current plan suitable for this customer?
  - answer: |
      Yes. Since the customer is over 55 and lives in Florida (an eligible state), 
      they can switch to the T-Mobile Essentials Choice 55 plan. 
      It would lower their monthly cost as it is priced at $60/month.
    context: |
      | **Customer ID** | **Age** | **Current Plan** | **Lines** | **Location**       |
      |------------------|--------|------------------|-----------|--------------------|
      | 006              | 68     | Essentials       | 2         | Florida            |
    question:  Is this customer eligible for a 55+ plan, and would it be beneficial?
  - answer: |
      Yes. The Experience Beyond w/ Military Savings plan offers the same premium benefits at a lower price. 
      Since the customer is a verified veteran, this switch will reduce their monthly bill.
    context: |
      | **Customer ID** | **Military Status** | **Verified** | **Current Plan** | **Lines** |
      |------------------|---------------------|--------------|------------------|-----------|
      | 008              | Retired Veteran     | Yes          | Experience Beyond     | 3         |
    question: Should this customer be moved to the Military plan?
  - answer: |
      Based on your relatively low data usage and limited streaming needs,
      you could switch from Experience Beyond to the Experience More plan or even consider Essentials. 
      This could reduce your monthly bill by $30â€“80 without significantly affecting your experience.
    context: |
      | **Monthly Data Usage** | **Streaming Hours/Day** | **Current Plan** | **Monthly Bill** | **Lines** |
      |-------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|

    question:  Help me lower my monthly cost.
